# Xcode Project Template

Please use this template as a base for starting any iOS project.

It will help you get up and running much more quickly.  You can also use it to quickly test things too.

It's a "living document", so feel free to modify the project.


## Usage

Do a git export of the latest commited version of the code.

Navigate to:  /source
Then run:  ./init.rb
